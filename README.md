# workload

A web solution for the quantification of the workload of teachers

This is my first aplication with spring boot, so there are too many bugs. Some corrections are required, but this solution is working
almost everywhere.

This product is the result of a competition at the Technological University of Paran√° (UTFPR), which was the winner. Many cutting-edge
technologies have been used in the design.
